# Shop Night — Fabrication Highlights

Our most recent shop night focused on fabrication techniques and hands-on training for new members. The Fabrication subteam led demonstrations and supervised small-group exercises so attendees could learn skills that directly contribute to working on the car.

## Overview

The evening started with a safety briefing and a short walkthrough of the shop layout. We then split into three stations:

- Welding fundamentals and practice jigs
- Fixture setup and alignment
- Trim, deburring, and final-fit checks

Experienced team members ran each station, demonstrating techniques and supervising practice work. By the end of the night, newcomers had completed small practice pieces and helped advance a couple of real assemblies.

---

## What we accomplished

- Taught MIG welding basics and safe torch handling to 12 participants.
- Completed two small gusset plates for the front subframe and tacked them into place for final fitment.
- Set up a welding jig for brake lever brackets, reducing fixture time for future builds.
- Performed fitment checks on an assembly that was then moved from prototype to final stage.

These incremental advances help keep build momentum while giving new members meaningful, supervised experience.

## Skills & techniques covered

- Personal protective equipment (PPE) and shop safety protocols
- Welding setup: gas mix, wire selection, and machine settings
- Proper workholding and jigging for repeatable fabrication
- Measuring and layout techniques (using calipers, squares, and surface plates)
- Deburring and surface prep for paint/finish stages

Each participant had an opportunity to practice under supervision — we emphasized safe, repeatable techniques over speed.

## Tools & materials used

- MIG welder (15–20 AWG wire) and welding carts
- Brake press and hand deburring tools
- Assorted clamps, fixturing plates, and alignment pins
- Basic measuring tools: calipers, dial indicators, machinist square

If you plan to attend future sessions, please bring closed-toe shoes and long pants. Eye protection was provided, but you may bring your own safety glasses if preferred.

## Challenges & lessons learned

- We noticed several practice pieces with inconsistent fit due to fixturing tolerances — we updated the jig alignment checklist to include a quick two-point reference step.
- Some attendees needed a refresher on basic measuring technique, so we'll add a short "measurement fundamentals" mini-session at the start of the next shop night.
- Managing tool flow in a crowded shop remains a challenge; we'll optimize station placement and add one more instructor to improve throughput.

---

## Next steps

- Finalize the welds on the tacked gusset plates and schedule a low-stress test before paint prep.
- Host a short training session on blueprint reading and part interpretation.
- Prepare a materials list and sign-up for volunteers to finish the brake lever bracket run.

## Photos & sharing

We took photos and short clips of the welding station and completed assemblies. These will be uploaded to the team gallery and the comms channels later this week. If you took photos, please send them to the communications lead.

## Get involved

New members are always welcome. If you enjoyed the session and want to help move assemblies to completion, join the Fabrication subteam or come to the next public shop night. Questions or suggestions? Reach out via the contact page or message the Fabrication lead on the team Slack.

Thanks to everyone who helped run the session and to all the new members for their enthusiasm — looking forward to seeing more work completed next shop night!
