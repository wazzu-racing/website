# Regional Competition Recap

We had a strong showing at the regional competition. Read about challenges we overcame, lessons learned, and highlights from the weekend.

Wazzu Racing traveled to the regional competition with high hopes and a committed team. Over the weekend we completed the endurance run and placed well in the design review. This recap summarizes the event, the technical highlights, and the improvements we'll carry forward into the next season.

## Overview

The team departed early on competition day after a final systems check and brief team meeting. Our strategy focused on reliability and consistent lap times rather than pushing the car to its absolute performance limits. The plan paid off: the car completed the endurance session with no major failures, and our pit crew executed several quick service stops that kept us competitive.

## Highlights

- Completed the endurance run without mechanical failures.
- Strong performance in the design review; judges praised the clarity of our trade studies.
- Quick, well-coordinated pit stops—practice paid off.
- A successful last-minute suspension tweak resulted in improved stability on high-speed corners.

## Technical Challenges & Fixes

During the first day of dynamic events, we noticed increased understeer at high speed. The Fabrication and Suspension subteams collaborated on a small but effective tweak to the front anti-roll setup. The change improved turn-in and reduced tire scrub on the outside compound.

Other notable fixes:
- Adjusted brake bias slightly after telemetry showed rear locking tendencies under heavy braking.
- Corrected a minor wiring harness chafe found during pre-race inspection.

These adjustments were low-effort but high-impact and demonstrated the value of cross-subteam troubleshooting under time pressure.

## Lessons Learned

1. Documentation is critical. When a minor issue appeared, having clear wiring and mechanical diagrams cut troubleshooting time in half.
2. Practice pit procedures under realistic pressure. The practice sessions we ran on campus directly translated to faster, less error-prone stops at the competition.
3. Plan for contingency: we carried a small set of common spares and fasteners, which saved time when small parts loosened or needed replacement.

## Team & Community

A competition is as much about people as it is about engineering. We were grateful for:
- Faculty advisors for technical guidance,
- Alumni volunteers for logistical support,
- On-site volunteers and friends who helped with setup and crowd engagement.

If you'd like to get involved, reach out via the contact page or come to our next public shop night.

## Next Steps

- Incorporate the judges' feedback into our next design iteration.
- Plan a focused test day to validate the suspension changes at higher speeds.
- Continue recruitment push to expand the test and fabrication squads.

Thanks to everyone who supported us — volunteers, faculty advisors, alumni, and the broader WSU community. We couldn't have done it without you!
