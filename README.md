# Wazzu Racing Website

This is the main public-facing website for Wazzu Racing. It's still very much in construction.

Wazzu Racing is a student club at Washington State University that designs a formula-style car each year
and competes against other teams from around the world.


## Development
Clone the repo if needed, install dependencies with npm, and start a development server.

```sh
npm install # Installs dependencies
npm run dev -- --open # Opens the app in a new browser tab
```

To create a production build, run `npm run build` and then `npm run preview` to
preview it.



# Things to work on
- Check branding (branding.wsu.edu)
- page with all cars
- maybe add about different events
- IDEA: List of alumni, and where they've been hired
